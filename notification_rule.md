# üìå Notification Subscription Task: Implement client subscription functionality

## üßæ User Story

> As an admin user,
I want to be able to create a notification rule,
And add condition groups to the rule,
And assign members to each group,
So that I can control and configure how and to whom notifications should be sent based on specific criteria.



---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
I can create a new notification rule with a name and description.

‚úÖ I can define one or more condition groups under a rule, each with logical operators (e.g., AND, OR).

‚úÖ I can add one or more conditions to each group (e.g., field, comparison, value).

‚úÖ I can assign members (e.g., user or target IDs) to each group who should receive the notification if the group conditions are met.

‚úÖ When all conditions in a group are met (based on the group‚Äôs operator), notifications should be triggered to the specified members.

‚úÖ I can update or remove groups and members as needed after rule creation.
